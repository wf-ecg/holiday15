  get a correct/anagram pair
  PAIR = {
    correct: 'GARETH', // reference
    anagram: 'THRAGE',
  }
  make [solving] from anagram

  solving[ [T H R A G E]
  sequence function () {
    return one of [1 2 3 4 5 6]
  }

  tiles are made from original [solving] (array from anagram) (which then mutates)
  values are checked against [correct]


  tile [solving[] array
  tell each to draw
